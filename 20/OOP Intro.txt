why oop?
	first of all oop is a way to code not a seprate language
	main intent of c++ is to add OOP in C programming
	because it increase readability, maintainability, and due to bug-free nature of program
	before this data security was easily compromised but classes solve this problem by modeling program as real world scenario
	in procedural language data move function to function openly using local and global variables
concept of oop:
	oop work on the concept of classes and objects
class:
	classes are a template to create objects,
	treat data as critical element
	build data and function around the objects
object:
	objects are runtime Entities
Abstraction:
	it is a process of hiding internal details of an applictaion from outer world
	also used to explain things in simple terms and used to create boundary b/w application and client program
	--> layer inside layer (layer by layer structure
Encapsulation:
	wrapping up data and functions into single unit
Inheritance:
	proprities of one class can be inherited by other
polymorphism:
	ability to take more then one form
Dynamic Binding:
	which code will be execute is not known untill program runs
Message passing:
	Object.message("information")  >>> call formate of class function
Benifits of OOP:
	code reuseability
	data hiding
	secure systems
	Multiple objects can co-exist without interference
	software complexity can be easily managed
